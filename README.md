## 🧠 Overview

This repository powers my personal portfolio interface.

It provides two execution modes:

### 0️⃣ One Page — `STRAIGHT_FORWARD`

A high-efficiency, single-page professional node.

* Zero navigation friction
* Rapid recruiter review
* Structured output
* Minimal latency UI
  
### 1️⃣ Immersive Deck — `GLITCH_OS`

A high-fidelity operating system–style interface.

* Interactive modules
* Mission logs
* Project telemetry
* Structured narrative architecture

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio is built to reflect:

* Systems thinking
* Hybrid engineering mindset
* Interface design experimentation
* Structured presentation of technical work

It is not a template.
It is a controlled execution environment.
